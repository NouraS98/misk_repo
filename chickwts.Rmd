```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

Can you format the table a bit more nicely?

```{r  ,echo=FALSE , warning = FALSE ,message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
chickwts %>% group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            avg = mean(weight),
            SD = sd(weight)) 

```

Tehre should be a boxplot

```{r , echo=FALSE , warning = FALSE ,message = FALSE}
chickwts %>% 
  ggplot(aes (x= feed , y = weight)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl,
               fun.args = list(mult = 1), 
               col = "Red" ) +
  labs(x= "data" , y= "mean")
```


What happpened with the rest of the stats?
